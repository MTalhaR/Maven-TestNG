parallel testing:
for parallel testing we need to enter only few paremters in our testng xml
we can have them in suite or test tag

if we want to execute two or more <test> in parallel we will add them in suite tag


if we want to execute two or more <classes> in parallel we will add them in <test> tag


e.g
<test   parallel ="classes", thread-count="2">

<classes>
		<class name ="a"/>
		<class name="b"/>
</classes>

</test>

class a and b will execute in parallel
